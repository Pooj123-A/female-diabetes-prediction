    ## What is diabetes

    According to the NIH, "Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your **blood glucose**,
     also called blood sugar, is **too high**. Blood **glucose** is your main source of
      energy and **comes from the food you eat**. **Insulin**, a hormone made from the pancreas,
       **helps glucose** from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your 
       body doesn’t make enough or any insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays 
       in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.
    Over time, **having too much glucose in your blood** can cause health problems. """)
